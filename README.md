## Background

The real-time synthesis UGens, SynthDefs, and signal flow components necessary 
to offload Sonic Multiplicities' audio processing functionality to the web
browser. This leads to the immediate benefits of lower round-trip latencies and
more stable performance sessions overall for lower-end computer hardware.
